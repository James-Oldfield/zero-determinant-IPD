# zero-determinant iterated prisoner's dilemma

A python program to simulate games involving player X playing an exploitive zero-determinant strategy, for coursework.

## todo

- [x] Allow analytic computation of expected long-term payoffs
- [ ] Create interface to simulate iterated games with given strategies
- [ ] Allow second player—Y—to play non-evolutionary strategy => ultimatum game

## install

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

## run

#### compute long term payoffs of Markov Matrix

```bash
python main.py
python main.py --debug=True # to print debugging status
```
